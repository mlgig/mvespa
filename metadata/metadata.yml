description: 'Force plates and optical motion capture (OMC) are commonly used for
  performance assessment during motor tasks. However, these systems are expensive
  and available to a small few. In addition, OMC involves the careful placement of
  markers for every session. Moreover, the awareness of markers may affect the athlete''s
  performance. Therefore, recent research has focused on markerless motion capture
  (MMC), especially now that people can independently record their daily activities
  and physical tests using their own smartphones. However, there is still much to
  be done in validating MMC systems based on accuracy requirements for different application
  contexts. This study evaluates the accuracy and feasibility of MMC with a single
  smartphone in measuring jump height, velocity, flight time, contact time, and range
  of motion (ROM) during a wide range of motor tasks. Sixteen healthy adult volunteers
  (mean age: 30.9 Â± 7.2 years) each performed three repetitions of selected tests
  while body movement was simultaneously recorded using force plates, OMC and a single
  smartphone camera. Next, we performed MMC on the exercise videos using an open-source
  OpenPose model. Then, we evaluated MMC in measuring participants'' performance with
  the force plates and OMC as ground truths. MMC showed great promise in quantifying
  jump heights and velocity with ICC up to 0.97. However, mostly poor agreement was
  shown in measuring flight and contact time. For the ROM and angular velocity tests,
  MMC showed poor to moderate agreement. These results suggest that monocular 2D MMC
  may be a viable alternative to OMC or force plates, for objective assessment of
  sports performance capacity during jumps and velocity-based tests, while for ROM
  tests, MMC could be used for enhanced visual feedback.'
